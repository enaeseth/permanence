Permanence
==========

Permanence lets you record scheduled shows from an audio source ([JACK][jack],
an Internet radio stream, etc.) and save them to disk or a server. Some of
Permanence's features:

- Flexible storage: recorded files are passed to storage drivers which can do
  anything they want with the files: copy them to a new location on disk,
  upload them to a server, etc.
- Extensible: you can provide new source and storage drivers to handle
  technologies that Permanence doesn't cover out of the box
- Open: you can install scripts and Python functions as Permanence "hooks" that
  will get called when specific events happen, such as when Permanence finishes
  recording a show

Permanence has been used internally by [KRLX radio][krlx] to record copies of
their productions since May 2009. If you think Permanence could be useful for
your needs, contact us at [computing@krlx.org](mailto:computing@krlx.org).
